# number of nodes/pixels per tile/square on unity map 
## width 
```
width = (12 squares * 10 squares/tile) + 5 squares on end = 125 
pixels (or nodes) per width block = (1254 pixels) / 125 = 100.32
```
## height
```
height = (9 squares * 10 squares/tile) + 2 + 1.5 squares on end = 93.5~
pixels (or nodes) per height block = (936 pixels) / 93.5 = 10.01~
```
* so each individual tile contains 10 pixels in x direction and 10 pixels in y direction 
* total area = 10*10 = 100 pixels
